# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

This project focuses on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), analyzing voice data rather than just words. The same words can be spoken with different tones, conveying vastly different emotions.

Using deep learning and signal processing techniques, this project aims to classify emotions from speech audio data. Potential applications include human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and mental health monitoring.

### Features

- Preprocessing of speech data (MFCC, Mel spectrograms, etc.)

- Deep learning models for emotion classification

- Visualization of audio features and model performance
